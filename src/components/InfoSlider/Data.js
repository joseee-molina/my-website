    "While in High School, I participated in many math, physics and chemistry competitions in the National and International level. I was the valedictorian of my class. I got the BBVA Foundation Scholarship and a full-ride scholarship to study in Tsinghua University, in Beijing. I was part of the top 5% international students while studying there. I participated in the Facebook International Hackathon of Latin America (2021) and my team finished 8th overall. I transferred to UT Dallas and got the PPESM Financial Award. I was selected as a CS Talent Scholar by Edlyft (YC W20). ",
