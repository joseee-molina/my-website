    "The challenges I've encountered have provided me with invaluable lessons that continue to shape my journey. My participation in Math Olympiads during high school laid the foundation for my understanding of theoretical physics at Tsinghua University. My time at Tsinghua further honed my skills as a scientist and programmer, opening doors to internships at both a YCombinator startup and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Additionally, I've discovered ways to inspire others and contribute to my community. Earlier this year, I collaborated with the Admissions Office at UT Dallas to introduce a new series of bilingual tours, specifically designed for Latino families whose primary language is Spanish.",
